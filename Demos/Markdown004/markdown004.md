# Foundations of American Democracy
### ***Types of Democracy***
*  **Participatory Democracy:** Direct democracy - emphasizes broad participation in the political process by most, if not all, members of society.
* **Pluralist Democracy:** groups of people associate with interest groups who them compete to influence policy (Political parties)
* **Elite Democracy:** Limited participation in policy making on the assumption that government is complicated and the most educated people to run it
* **Republicanism:** People elect leaders to represent them and create laws in the public interest, representative

### ***Principles of democracy***
* **Natural rights:** rights people posses by natural law apart from a government
* **Popular Sovereignty:** by nature, the power to govern is in the hands of the people
* **Social Contract:** People willingly give up some of that power away to a government, in order to protect their natural rigths
* **Limited Government:** A government that is prevented from tyranny through a system of checks and balances and distribution of power among several acting members
* **Separation of powers:** (Fed 51. -Montesquieu) Power split into Legislative, Executive, and Judicial (Federal and Supreme Courts)
---
### ***Constitutional Compromises***
* **The Great Compromise:** How people would be represented in new congress
* **Three-Fifths Compromise:** 3/5 enslaved population would count towards representation
---
### ***Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists***
* **Anti federalism** (Brutus) =  no bigger central government and large republic- they fear the government taking away peoples rights, opt for not ratifying new constitution
* Brutus N.1 Anti Federalist Paper
* **Federalist:** They WANT a new constitution, ratify it.
Federalism - protection built in structure, separation of power.

### ***Clauses***
* **Elastic clause, Necessary and Proper Clause:** Stretch power, expand Congress powers, create tyranny, deciding they need a bank
* **Commerce Clause:** allows congress regulate economic actions that crosses between states (business, money) 
Fed 10. James Madison
* **Supremacy Clause:** This clause in the new Constitution was  feared because it gave the new, national government ultimate authority when it came to power disputes between the national and state govenrments.

## ***Notes***
* Factions: Groups of people with common goals, they are inevitable, it's human nature; they are a way to prevent from being problematic/dangerous to society, encourage large republic, larger taking power, so more people = more diversity (thoughts & opinions), therefore less likely for 1 to win overall control. 
Ex. Democrats and Republicans - want power
> McCulloh V. Maryland
* The states have the power to, 1st created was allowed to die
* 1816: 2nd national bank created because of war , it was set up in Maryland, democratic republicans control that state and try to impose tax to bank to try to ruin it
* James McCulloh, in charge of bank, refused to pay, states can't tax federal government
1. Congress DID have th authority to create national bank = Court Decision
Necessary and Proper Clause, make all laws that are necessary and proper
1. States can't tax national government, under supremacy clause: federal law > state laws and constitution 
"The power to tax involves the power to destroy" - Marshall
1. Expands national power, Anti federalists think this case is not good
they fear a 'too' strong government and fear that congress will make whatever laws they want
>US V. LOPEZ
* 1990 - congress creates law - gun free zones act saying 1000 ft of any school no fire arms allowed. under commerce clause
* Supreme court says this act is unconstitutional, states can make law but congress overstepped power, this act was not related to commerce clause (congress had power taken away; constricted) anti federalist approve this decision
* John Locke - life ,liberty, property, born with these rights
* Madison - fed 10 - concerned about factions squashing peoples rights
* "None could prevail all of the time"
* Articles of Confederation: lack of central government, lack of monet, no president, no federal court, only one branch of federal government (Congress)
* Congress had no power to raise revenue through taxes, had no power to raise an army
* Philadelphia - was to amend not to create a new constitution, it ends up starting over and they create a whole new government
* Virginia Plan - Congressional representatives should be apportired. Big steps = more representatives
* Electoral College - one of Compromises, slavery
* Checks and balances give the branches power to limit and influence the actions of the other branches.
