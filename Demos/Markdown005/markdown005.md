Factions: Groups of people with common goals, they are inevitable, it's human nature; they are a way to prevent from being problematic/dangerous to society, encourage large republic, larger taking power, so more people = more diversity (thoughts & opinions), therefore less likely for 1 to win overall control. Ex. Democrats and Republicans - want power | Articles of Confederation: lack of central government, lack of monet, no president, no federal court, only one branch of federal government (Congress)
The states have the power to, 1st created was allowed to die | Supreme court says this act is unconstitutional, states can make law but congress overstepped power, this act was not related to commerce clause (congress had power taken away; constricted) anti federalist approve this decision
1816: 2nd national bank created because of war , it was set up in Maryland, democratic republicans control that state and try to impose tax to bank to try to ruin it |1990 - congress creates law - gun free zones act saying 1000 ft of any school no fire arms allowed (under commerce clause)

1. Congress DID have th authority to create national bank = Court Decision
Necessary and Proper Clause, make all laws that are necessary and proper
1. States can't tax national government, under supremacy clause: federal law > state laws and constitution 
"The power to tax involves the power to destroy" - Marshall
1. Expands national power, Anti federalists think this case is not good
they fear a 'too' strong government and fear that congress will make whatever laws they want
* John Locke - life ,liberty, property, born with these rights
* Madison - fed 10 - concerned about factions squashing peoples rights
* "None could prevail all of the time"
* Congress had no power to raise revenue through taxes, had no power to raise an army
* Philadelphia - was to amend not to create a new constitution, it ends up starting over and they create a whole new government
* Virginia Plan - Congressional representatives should be apportired. Big steps = more representatives
* Electoral College - one of Compromises, slavery
* Checks and balances give the branches power to limit and influence the actions of the other branches.
